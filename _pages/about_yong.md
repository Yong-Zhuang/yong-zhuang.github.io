I am an Assistant Professor in the School of Computing at Grand Valley State University, specializing in machine learning and data mining.

My research focuses on applied machine learning, with an emphasis on spatio-temporal analysis, time series forecasting, and causal analysis for feature selection. I develop methods to enhance predictive modeling and improve data-driven decision-making across various domains.

I earned my Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of Massachusetts Boston. Before transitioning to academia, I worked in the tech industry, where I focused on web application design and machine learning system development, integrating practical applications with research advancements.
